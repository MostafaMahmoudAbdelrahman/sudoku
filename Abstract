The purpose of this essay is to implement and study different techniques for solving Sudoku puzzles , a problem similar to graph coloring with fixed size and dependencies.
Three approaches are presented and compared regarding efficiency (time needed, space required and success rate).
These approaches are rule-based solving, simulated annealing, and searching for solutions.
Finally the parts found to be most important for an efficient solver are combined, creating an even better solver
